rn my program has only 4 data types int, float, double, char
no expression has () or {} or []
arrays are declared as data_type name[], no malloc business for now
a block is defined by func/for loop/ do/ while/switch
2 funcs with same name- not allowed
2 cases of switch with same constant: will work but not allowed

can't have num, need to have a number

for(int i=0;i<3;i++); not allowed as scope changes back only on encountering a '}'
